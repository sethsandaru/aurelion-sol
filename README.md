## Data Decision

### Trim on retrieval

Every time the system extracts the data from 3rd-party, always `trim($string)` before setting it.

This would help us to clear the starting & ending spaces of a string (and some other special characters).

### Auto Replace on `null`

If the `column` is `null` and the given value is not, automatically apply the value to the column.

### Greedy on long-string-column

If you know SEO, people always says this: "Content is King". The longer content, the better SEO & ranking.

So for example, if the current description field is shorter than the given value, apply the new value to the description column.

### Unique Options

For those columns which contains multiple options, ensure the options are "unique" when merging.

## Tests

I love test & TDD. This project is covered by Unit Tests & Integration Tests.
